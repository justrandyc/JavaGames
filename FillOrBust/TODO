Rules yet to program that my game does not do:

1. allow point dice to be selected and re-rolled per the rules

	As I read the rules, you MUST keep SOME points wtih
	each roll, but say you rolled three 2's and a 1.  I
	believe you can keep the 1 and reroll the 2's (I guess
	hoping they work out to better than 200 points)

	currently, all points count and cannot be rerolled

2. vengeance when there's a tie for the lead
	(tied with card flipper or just two other players)

	If I am tied for the lead and flip the vengeance card,
	I believe the rules say I can indeed destroy my enemy
	by playing the vengeance, and they lose 2500 points 
	while I do not.

	Also, say I am in 3rd place and there are two leaders
	tied.  The vengeance card should remove 2500 from both
	the leaders (perhaps vaulting me into 1st place!)

	currently it takes it from the first leader found
	but not if that's you

3. Buttons available for each situation should highlight

	This is a nice-to-have feature not yet implemented.
	You want to know what options you have at any given
	time.  Right now, you can just "try" and if you can't
	do it, it just doesn't work.

	for instance, if you have a Fill 1000 card and you 
	try to end your turn before finishing the fill, it
	just ignores you.
