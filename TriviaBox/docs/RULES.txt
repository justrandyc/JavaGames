Welcome to the Trivia Box Sofware, REwritten in
August 2017 by Randy Crihfield.

All questions are worth 6 points if answered on
the first try.  Each "miss" scores -1 and lowers
the overall question score by one point.

So suppose there are three players.  Suppose all
three miss once and then #3 answers correctly.
The score would be -1 -1 2.  (all three lost one
point but the third player gets 3 points for
getting it right)

Suppose on the next question #1 misses and #2 gets
it right.  Now the score is -2 4 2 (the first 
player loses *another* point and the second player
scores 5)

And of course on the next question if #1 gets it
right now the score is 4 4 2 (6 points scored)


At the end your percentage of right/wrong plus
overall score is there for all to see.  Good
luck!

You can create your OWN questions by editing 
the game.dat file.  The question format is
provided in the file itself.

Probably some bugs in the scoring, I was MUCH more
interested in the hardware side than the software....
