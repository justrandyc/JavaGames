# The game.dat file contains questions, answers, and
# responses.  They will be read from top to bottom.
#
# The syntax for the file is:
#
#	QST:Some question that is all on one line
#	COR:1
#	ANS:Some answer all on one line
#	ANS:The second answer...
#	RES:The response for each answer
#	RES:Second answer response...
#
# where 
#	QST is the question
#	COR is the number of the correct answer (may be 1-6. There
#		may be only ONE correct answer at this time. Use 
#		"all of the above" or some such phrasing to get
#		fancy.)
#	ANS is one of 6 possible answers.  You have to have at least
#		one but you don't have to list all 6 every time (ie
#		for a true/false question).  However, do have all 6
#		ANS lines there even if you only want one answer. 
#		Just leave them blank: ANS:
#	RES is the response.  There must be one for every QST.
#
# You MUST have your entire question, answer, or response on one line.
# This may make for a very long line but them's the rules, for now.
