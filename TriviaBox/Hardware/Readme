This is currently based on a Teensy 2.0 board.  The .ino source is contained
in the Teensy directory.

For consistency, I used "A" style wiring for the RJ45 on the server module.
The wiring to solder to the Teensy, in order is

Ground	- Brown

Red	- Orange
Orange	- Blue
Yellow	- Green
Green	- Brown+White
Blue	- Blue+White
Purple	- Orange+White
Next	- Green+White

from there, every 7 digital i/o pins on the Teensy are repeated. The grounds
all tie together.

The Teensy 2.0 only has 25 i/o pins, so you need at most the ground + 21 of them.
That gives you 3 controllers (7+7+7) with 4 left over.  Obviously a bigger Teensy
would give you the ability to have more controllers.

Actually, combinations would allow zillions of them (pin 1+2, 1+3, 1+4 vs 2+3, 2+4...)
but I didn't do it this way.  Three controllers is sufficient.  Teensy 2.0 boards
cost about $12 so it's hard to beat the price... the buttons and boxes cost more!

On the RJ45 riser, I have soldered the buttons in this order:

Ground	1 - all buttons one side
Red	3
Orange	5
Yellow	7
Green	2
Blue	4
Purple	6
Next	8
